What does it do?
This program has four different functions, but overall, it aims to inform users about how to use government digital services by taking suggestions from users, reviewing them, and putting them into the software for others to find

How to install?
All you would have to do is execute the code file, but to make sure that the database with the information is accessible, download and store it in the same folder, with the name remaining the same as when you downloaded it.

What features are available?
It has four functions available from the starting page. They can be accessed by entering the relevant number prompted when the code is run into the interface. They are as follows:
o	Search: enter a sentence or question and the keywords are compared to the database which will bring up suggestions to pages to look at.
o	Manual: Pages in the database can be browsed for (or topic names entered).
o	Links: Helpful links to other pages/websites can be found here. You can also suggest links to websites.
o	Suggestions: Anything you suggest here will be reviewed and uploaded to the system

Are there any know issues?
As and when the database is updated, to access the new information, the database file will have to be re-downloaded.
Some features have not been finished yet - ideally there would be a website or online database that the program can access, instead of just having a text file that is downloaded to the computer.
